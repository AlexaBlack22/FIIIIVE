# fiiiiive
Sort of alchemic sequencer for monome norns, sequencing five by five to escape tonality.
A cryptic way to generate sequences that can be also played by MIDI notes.

# requirements
norns, MIDI

enc 1 -> circles scroll<br>

<b>top circles - serie of intervals / play and tempo signauture</b><br>
enc2 -> select serie step<br>
enc3 -> change serie interval<br>
key2 -> play and stop<br>
key3 + enc1 -> select preset<br>
key3 + key2 -> save preset<br>
key2 + enc2 or enc3 -> serie range<br>
key3 + enc2 or enc3 -> tempo signature numerator and denominator<br>

<b>Other circles</b><br>
triangles are amplitudes, squares are durations, pentagons are serie select, and circles of circles are octaves<br>
key2 -> master step backward<br>
key3 -> master step forward<br>
enc2 -> setting step by cycles step select<br>
enc3 -> setting step by cycles step set<br>
key2 + enc2 or enc3 -> set master sequence range<br>
key2 + enc2 or enc3 -> set setting sequences ranges<br>
